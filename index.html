                    <h2>How it started</h2>
                    <p>
                        There was a time that i saw a gorgeous girl at this cosplay event/convention and she was cosplaying as one of the
                        iconic characters in a video game Ada Wong. I was mesmerized on how pretty was she and of course her eyes 
                        it was like sparkling and dazling it was straight up perfect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can think im overeacting but no, I speak based on what I trully feel and what i see. Anyways back to my topic 
                        you can most say its like love at first sight (i sound so cringe wth T*T). So then after I admire how pretty was she 
                        i build up my confidence then asked her to have a picture of us (sorry cant provide the first pic we took i cant find it anymore TT)
                        after we took the pic she suddently dissappeared and didnt even have a chance to asked her name (legit bigla kang nawala). And thats how i met her.

                    <h2> </h2>
                    <p>
                        When i got home i immediately looked-up the event in social media to hope that i can get her name. Minutes, hours, days
                        of searching i coudnt find her. The event held on the day after my birthday on april last year, I even asked my only coser
                        friend in hopes that she might know her socials. After a month of failed searching i was feeling unmotivated, so i stop and focus on
                        upcoming school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then after that the day was here, First day of classes. On the first day of my college year i was actually almost late for my first
                        class that time (late nagising), I immediately hop on the elevator (muntik pa maging kwento kasi naipit) when suddenly i saw a familiar
                        presence, i wasnt sure that time and i didnt even bother because i was really late (bakit kasi hindi nag alarm TT) but thankfully 
                        our first prof wasnt even there yet so theoretically im still not late.

                    <p>
                        After a week in school I saw a very familiar face, and upon observing my heart race as fast as it could. It was her, i can already
                        tell that it was her because of her iconic eyes, it was still gorgeous as the day i first saw it. My hopes were up and it was like
                        the universe was on my side to finally see her again. My friend actually saw me looking at her and  tells me that he know her, I 
                        blantly asked and finally i got to know her name. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Weeks of admiration led me to know that she was actually joining in a school event a dancing competition to be exact. Me and my other
                        friends cheer at them, and after that i got a second chance to have a picture with her (paos pako non kakasigaw tas hinila nila jerbie TT)
                        i was so shy that time because we were both a complete stranger (gusto ko magpabaon 9 feet underground non) but to me it was special.
                        Then of course i shoot my shot and chatted her then the rest is history.

                        I dont even know what to say (kainin ako ng lupa pls) this is not a confession message or maybe or no or yes ewan k na huhu, but one
                        thing is for sure, firstly I can assure you that my intentions are pure and genuine. Maniwala ka man or hindi
                        but I'm not here just bc I'm bored or whatsoever, my momma didn't teach me to play peoples feelings but instead she always taught me
                        that always treat a girl like a queen or princess.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also I still make mistakes just like every other person. I can be annoying sometimes or kaya baka medyo nag ffeeling close nako. If pag 
                        satingin mo na ooccupy ko na personal boundaries/space or pag naliligaligan kana sa friends ko kaka-asar sakin do tell me so I can stop 
                        immediately and apologize. I created this to just express what i wanted to say u dont have to reply or say anything after u read this
                        I wanted to express my gratitude for making me feel alive again. thankyou trully ≧▽≦ (this is so akward TT) anw idk how will u take this
                        but yes HADHADHSHDADASHD sana d ka magsawa sakin.
